1.) Livestreaming allows people to stream what they are doing in realtime. To livestream all you need is an internet connection and a site or app that you can livestream from: Twitch, Mixer, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Periscope, etc. Livestreaming is a way to entertain, connect with people, share what you are doing, and in some cases make a lot of money.

2.) Some of the most important companies in livestreaming are Twitch, Mixer, and YouTube. These three platforms are the most popularly used ones for streamers. Twitch being the most widely used. Some of the most important streamers are Ninja, Tfue, Dr DisRespect, Summit1G, Shroud,... There are a lot of really big ones. These streamers average 10s of thousands of viewers everytime that they go live and thus have a lot of influence in the streaming community and the community of the game that they livestream.

3.) There are really two main historical events when it comes to livestreaming's development: 2007 - the first streaming platform LiveStream was created, and 2010 Justin.tv, which is now Twitch, was created. 

LiveStream was the first platform which is why it is historic and Twitch was really simple to use and helped make livestreaming mainstream which is why it is a turning point in the history of livestreaming. 

The growth of livestreaming is directly linked to the growth of gaming as almost every stream on one of the platforms is someone playing a video game. More gamers-> bigger community -> more streamers -> growth of streaming platforms -> growth of livestreaming. Before livestreaming platforms became popular people would just post YouTube videos of their gameplay, but when Twitch came out people could not only make money off YouTube videos, but they could also livestream to their fans and get donations and subscription revenue and then eventually sponsorships. So the development of gaming is linked to the development of livestreaming and Twitch was the platform that made it go mainstream.
